# MazePathGame

## Description
This game generates a nxn matrix maze that must be navigated. Path is displayed by pressing the answer button. It also displays the different algorithms and data structures used as well as information about them including tutorials and time complexity.

## Why was this made
To use a classic game for users to interactively learn about the utilization and importance of differnt data structures and search algorithms in a program.

## Prerequisites
Java version 1.8.0 and higher
Java SE JDK 8 or higher -- but it must be the same as Java version

## Prerequisites setup
Use this [link] (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) to download the appropriate JDK which also installs the Java version compatible.

## How to run
In a terminal or command line type ```cd src``` to the src folder. Next, ``` javac <YourMazePath>.java InputGraphicMaze.java <Your Intcoll>.java``` to compile. Then, ``` java <YourMazePath> ``` to run the program.

## How to use
You can try different data structures through the Intcoll*.java files and try A*, Hierarchical, DFS, BFS, Dijkstra pathfinding algorithms as the main program.

After running the src program file, enter the # of rows and columns for the matrix and it generates a random maze. 

The show path button shows the path to navigate the maze along with information about the data structure and algorithm including time complexity, rank, and time differnce.
